## App Brainstorming (Step 4)
1) Make a list of your favorite 3-5 applications and identify 2-3 features that make them your favorite app. It's okay if features repeat on different apps
DoorDash Driver
Navigation allows drivers to add multiple stops to a route or suggests additional deliveries along the existing route.
Chat function to speak with the customer
WhatsApp
Ability to record voice messages and videos to communicate with others.
Status feature that allows for the use of videos and text.
Encryption feature adds additional security. 
Apple Music
Karaoke feature that allows users to remove the artist’s voice and just hear the instrumentals.
Lyrics scroll while the songs are playing so users can learn the words.
Ability to create playlists or have them generated by the app and then listen to them offline. 


2) Think of an app idea that you would like to build. It can be a new idea or an improvement on an existing app. Write a short paragraph describing the app and the features you would like to implement. You are not committing to this idea, but it helps to start brainstorming early on and get feedback from your peers and instructors.
    When my wife was giving birth in the hospital, I realized that the employees are communicating with each other with small clip-on radios. However, they complained that this form of communication was not the most effective in a hospital setting. I would like to create an app that would not only allow for quick and easy communication between hospital staff, but would also connect with the patient’s data and share information with all employees responsible for the patient’s care. The app would be most easily used on an Apple Watch or similar device to allow for maximum portability and hands-free use in a hospital setting. The app would of course need to be highly secure and restricted to the hospital staff.


## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app:

My challenge were to link the label/button to change its color simultaneously, find the right buttons to do what I was intending to do (clear built folder). I spent so much time trying to run the simulator and Xcode showing te same error over and over even after I had deleted the whole code! When I understood the concept was quite satisfying! I am super excited about this course!
